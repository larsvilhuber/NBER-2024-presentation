abstract ={We examine causes and consequences of relative income within households. We show that the distribution of the share of income earned by the wife exhibits a sharp drop to the right of 12, where the wifeâ€™s income exceeds the husbandâ€™s income. We argue that this pattern is best explained by gender identity norms, which induce an aversion to a situation where the wife earns more than her husband. We present evidence that this aversion also impacts marriage formation, the wifeâ€™s labor force participation, the wifeâ€™s income conditional on working, marriage satisfaction, likelihood of divorce, and the division of home production. Within marriage markets, when a randomly chosen woman becomes more likely to earn more than a randomly chosen man, marriage rates decline. In couples where the wifeâ€™s potential income is likely to exceed the husbandâ€™s, the wife is less likely to be in the labor force and earns less than her potential if she does work. In couples where the wife earns more than the husband, the wife spends more time on household chores; moreover, those couples are less satisfied with their marriage and are more likely to divorce. These patterns hold both cross-sectionally and within couples over time. JEL Codes: D10, J12, J16.},

  title = {Essays in Applied Microeconomics},
  school = {Columbia University},
  year = {2012},
  note = {Advisor: Till von Wachter},
  abstract = {This dissertation consists of three essays in applied microeconomics.
	The first chapter looks at whether the Social Security claiming behavior
	of husbands respond to the presence of Social Security spouse and
	survivor benefits paid to wives based on his earnings record. I separately
	estimate the claiming response to incentives for each of the three
	types of Social Security benefits: retired worker, spousal, and survivor.
	This approach departs from the previous literature, which estimates
	behavioral responses to household incentives. I begin by documenting
	that failure to maximize household Social Security wealth results
	in a financial burden borne primarily by the wife. I next estimate
	husbands' behavioral response to Social Security benefit incentives,
	with my focus exclusively upon incentives due to the actuarial adjustment
	from delayed claiming. Variation in incentives comes from rule changes
	to the Social Security benefit calculation, in addition to the age
	difference between spouses and the relative strength of the wife's
	labor force history. I find while husbands are responsive to their
	own benefit incentives, they are barely responsive to household,
	spousal, and survivor benefit incentives. A variety of robustness
	checks looking at segments of the population predicted to be more
	responsive to incentives provide very similar results to main specification.
	The second chapter examines the incidence of health insurance coverage
	for displaced workers during the periods preceding and subsequent
	to job displacement. Most individuals lose health insurance coverage
	upon job separation. There is concern that individuals are unable
	to recover insurance coverage following separation. I find within
	18 months following job loss the level of health insurance coverage
	returns to pre-displacement level. Furthermore, I find that obtaining
	insurance coverage upon reemployment does not impact wages. The third
	chapter first examines how much of the fall in poverty among elderly
	women can be attributed to changes in the distributions of age, marital
	status, and education of elderly women using the Current Population
	Survey. Increased educational attainment has put tremendous downward
	pressure on the poverty rate driven primarily by the shift of high
	school dropouts to those with a high school diploma. I also find
	poverty would be slightly lower in the absence of changes to the
	age distribution and no direct impact on poverty levels due to the
	changes in distribution of marital status. I also investigate the
	role of both labor force participation and marital status over the
	life-cycle on old age outcomes using survey data matched to administrative
	earnings records from the Census Bureau. I find even after controlling
	for Social Security and marital status over prime-age years, lifetime
	earnings and labor force experience still has a significant impact
	on poverty incidence of elderly women. Projecting poverty for cohorts
	who have not reached old age, I find increased wages and LFP over
	the life-cycle places large downward pressure on predicted poverty.
	Marital status over the life-cycle exerts its own negative impact
	on poverty.},

  title = {The covariance of earnings and hours revisited},
  abstract = {In this paper we examine the earnings covariance matrix generated from a ten-year time series and estimate a variance components model that parameterizes the process generating earnings. We use our estimated variance components to test key hypotheses concerning life-cycle human capital investment and labor supply separately for men and women. Hu- man capital investment models predict that individuals with higher initial earnings have lower growth rates of earnings and that earnings follow a random growth model with individual specific rates of growth due to experience. Life-cycle labor supply models predict that variation in individual productivity affects earnings more than hours supplied. In order to test these hypotheses, we look for permanent individual variance components in the growth rate of earnings and significant auto-correlation in earnings overtime. We also test for the presence of a common component of variation between hours and earnings and explore how this component contributes to earnings relative to hours. We look for evidence to support or contradict the predictions of the models using a new data source â€” a set of SIPP panels linked to administrative tax data on labor market earnings. Our data contain Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) respondents from the five panels conducted by the Census Bureau in the 1990s with linked W-2 wage records filed by employers with the IRS. The sum of these wage records for a given year provides an uncapped annual earnings measure. We use survey information on the number of weeks worked full-time and part-time in a year to estimate annual hours worked. Because of the length of the time period covered (1990-1999), the size of the sample (approximately 230,000 individuals), and the high quality of the earnings measure, these data offer a unique opportunity to re-visit several classic labor economics questions and provide fresh evidence for on-going debate.},

  abstract = {The U.S. government subsidizes retirement saving through 401(k) plans with $61.4 billion in tax expenditures annually, but the question of whether these tax incentives are effective in increasing saving remains unanswered.  Using longitudinal U.S. Social Security Administration data on tax-deferred earnings linked to the Survey of Income and Program Participation, the project examines whether the â€œcatch-up provision,â€� which was enacted in 2001 and allows workers over age 50 to contribute more to their 401(k) plans, has been effective in increasing earnings deferrals.  Compared with similar workers under age 50, the study finds that contributions increased by $540 more among age-50-plus individuals who had approached the 401(k) tax-deferral limits prior to turning 50, suggesting that the older individuals respond to the expanded tax incentives.  For this group, the elasticity of retirement savings to the tax incentive is quite high: a one-dollar increase in the tax-deferred limit leads to an immediate 49-cent increase in 401(k) contributions.},

However, that research assumes husbands choose their claim age based on all Social Security incentives facing the household. I show that husbands' claiming behavior responds to the actuarial incentives built into their own retired worker benefit formula, but not to the incentives built into the spouse and survivor formulas that determine their wives' benefits. This failure to incorporate his spouses' incentives reduces wives' lifetime benefits. Variation in incentives comes from rule changes to the Social Security benefit calculation in addition to the age difference between spouses and the relative strength of the wife's labor force history.

In large part, this difficulty in providing access to business microdata is due to the skewed and sparse distributions that characterize business data. Synthetic data are simulated data generated from statistical models. We organized sessions at the 2015 World Statistical Congress and the 2015 Joint Statistical Meetings, highlighting work on synthetic \emph{establishment} microdata.

The shift-share style research design predicts county-level lending shocks using variation in pre-existing bank market shares and estimated bank supply-shifts. Counties with negative predicted supply shocks experienced declines in small business loan originations throughout the entire period, indicating that it is costly for these businesses to find new lenders. Using confidential microdata from the Longitudinal Business Database, we find the predicted lending shocks led to statistically significant, but economically small, declines in both small firm and overall employment during the Great Recession, but did not affect employment during the 1997-2007 period. Overall, this paper’s evidence fails to support the hypothesis that the small business lending channel is an important determinant of economic activity},

In this paper we use longitudinal administrative data from over 70,000 individuals in the Synthetic SIPP Beta to examine the earnings gap between mothers and non-mothers over the lifecycle and between cohorts. We observe women who never have children beginning to out earn women who will have children during their 20s. Gaps increase monotonically over the lifecycle, and decrease monotonically between cohorts from age 26 onwards. In our oldest cohort, lifetime gaps approach \$350,000 by age 62. Cumulative labor market experience profiles show similar patterns, with experience gaps between mothers and non-mothers generally increasing over the lifecycle and decreasing between cohorts. We decompose this cumulative gap in earnings (up to age 43) into portions attributable to time spent out of the labor force, differing levels of education, years of marriage and a number of demographic controls. We find that this gap between mothers and non-mothers declines from around \$220,000 for women born in the late 1940s to around \$160,000 for women born in the late 1960s. Over 80 percent of the change in this gap can be explained by variables in our model, with changes in labor force participation by far the best explanation for the declining gap. Comparing our oldest cohort as they approach retirement to the projected lifecycle behavior of the 1965 cohort, we find that the earnings gap is estimated to drop from \$350,000 (observed) to \$282,000 (expected) and that the experience gap drops from 3.7 to 2.1 years. We also explore the intensive margin costs of having a child. A decomposition of earnings gaps between mothers of one child and mothers of two children also controls for age at first birth. Here, we find a decline in the gap from around \$78,000 for our oldest cohorts to around \$37,000 for our youngest cohort},

note = {Advisor: Richard Burkhauser},
abstract = {My dissertation examines the effects that US Social Security policy changes have on labor supply and application behavior. In my first chapter, I use survey data matched to administrative records to measure the effect of a natural experiment in the provision of information - the introduction of the Social Security Statement - on Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) application behavior. I find that receipt of the Statement, a document gradually introduced in the 1990s which contained personalized information on all Social Security benefits, had a positive, substantial, and statistically significant effect on DI application, amounting to a 62 percent increase over the base rate. The overall effect was entirely driven by individuals reporting a work-limiting condition who were previously not employed. Furthermore, my analysis shows no evidence of applicants "shifting forward" their DI application. In the absence of these new applicants, the 32 percent growth rate of the per-capita DI rolls from 1995-2004 would have been approximately 25 percent, a 20 percent drop. My second chapter examines the impact of the Statement on individuals approaching retirement who are still working. I find that the effects are mixed: individuals working few hours per week prior to Statement receipt markedly increase their hours worked, while those working full time or more decrease their hours. However, it appears that individuals misunderstood that the Statement provided a retirement benefit projection based on constant earnings going forward. After second Statement receipt, those who previously decreased their labor supply then increased it. My third chapter uses program interactions between the two federal disability programs - DI and Supplemental Security Income - to estimate labor supply elasticities of DI beneficiaries. Given wide variation in SSI state supplements temporally and geographically and temporal variation in DI parameters, otherwise similar DI beneficiaries may face a 50 percent or 0 percent disability benefit reduction rate. This variation in marginal rate allows for a direct calculation of labor supply responsiveness to such a rate change. My elasticity estimates - the first for US disability beneficiaries based on differences in benefit reduction rates - are inelastic and low, ranging from -0.14 to -0.36 for the participation elasticity.},

  abstract  = {Most women receive some Social Security benefits based upon their husbands’ earnings history, but husbands’ benefit claiming is inconsistent with maximizing lifetime benefits for the couple. I show that husbands’ claiming behavior responds to the actuarial incentives from their retired worker benefits. Not responding to incentives from spouse and survivor formulas reduces wives’ lifetime benefits. Rule changes to the Social Security benefit calculation, the age difference between spouses, and the relative strength of the wife’s labor force history creates variation in incentives. Segments of the population predicted to be more responsive to incentives provides similar results to the main specification. },

In contrast to the apparent inconsistency in trends across administrative and survey data in the existing literature, we find recent increases in volatility in the SIPP GSF and the PSID, though increases are larger in the PSID. },

Employment fluctuations of startups are procyclical, they persist into later years, and cohort-level employment variations are largely driven by differences in firm size, rather than the number of firms. An estimated general equilibrium firm dynamics model reveals that aggregate conditions at birth, rather than post-entry choices, drive the majority of cohort-level employment variation by affecting the share of startups with high growth potential. In the aggregate, changes in startup conditions result in large, slow-moving fluctuations in employment.

We extend Hopenhayn and Rogerson's (1993) firm-dynamics model to allow for endogenous innovation. We evaluate the effects of firing taxes on reallocation, innovation, and productivity growth. We find firing taxes can have opposite effects on entrants' innovation and incumbents' innovation, and the overall outcome depends on the relative strengths of these forces. In the entrant-driven growth calibration, firing taxes reduce aggregate productivity growth, whereas aggregate productivity growth increases in the incumbent-driven growth calibration. }

Our focus is on redistribution across race and education groups. The cohorts we study are younger than cohorts studied in previous, similar research and thus more exposed to recent increases in earnings inequality. All else equal, this should increase the degree of progressivity of Social Security redistribution due to the structure of the benefit formula. However, we find that redistribution is only modestly progressive for individuals born as late as 1980. Differential mortality rates across race and education groups are the primary explanation. While Black–White mortality gaps have narrowed some in recent years, they remain large and dull progressivity. Mortality gaps by education level are also large and unlike the gaps by race, they are widening, which puts additional regressive pressure on Social Security redistribution.}
