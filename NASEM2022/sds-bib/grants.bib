abstract="Understanding of the workplace from the perspective of both employers and employees is vital for understanding human performance. Understanding the workplace can only occur if micro data on employers and employees are integrated, linked longitudinally and made accessible to the research community. Developing the data infrastructure for integrated data is a monumental task as the traditional approach towards data development is to collect data on households and businesses separately. Fortunately, such data collected separately can be integrated via the rich administrative data sets that contain information on both employers and employees that are available in the U.S. federal statistical system. Developing an access system for such data is also a monumental task because the underlying data on businesses and households are protected by legal confidentiality restrictions. Within the federal statistical system, integrated micro data can be created and the challenge is to make such data accessible to the user community for approved statistical purposes while protecting the confidentiality of the data. Existing access to such data is via an NSF/Census Research Data Center network. While this system has been very successful, there are a number of limitations so that, relative to the potential use of the micro data in the federal statistical system, the current use is very limited. This project outlines a multi-layered access structure that builds on recent data infrastructure developments and the access modalities as they currently exist. Key components of this multi-layered access structure are the development of inference-valid public use synthetic micro data, access to richer synthetic micro data at a virtual Research Data Center, and in turn limited access to the gold standard micro data in the Census/NSF Research Data Center network. The development of inference-valid synthetic data is a major undertaking at the frontier of statistical theory and applications. The development of the multi-layered access system is at the frontier of dealing with the confidentiality protection issues that must be confronted. The micro data on businesses and households (and especially the integrated data) are of fundamental importance for the social sciences and must be accessible to the research community but the confidentiality of these data must also be protected. This grant supports a prototype synthetic data system for one Census data product - the LEHD infrastructure files (individual, employer, job) to test the feasibility and usefulness of constructing synthetic data.

Broader Impacts of the Proposed Activity: The proposed activity has the potential for dramatically increasing access to micro data for the social science research community. This increased access will have broad impacts but even broader impacts arise for all scientific disciplines from the methodologies and protocols developed under this project. Rich integrated micro data on households and businesses are required to address a wide range of issues in the social sciences, health sciences, and environmental sciences. Developing such rich data, inference-valid synthetic data, and a multi-layered access system are issues confronting many different parts of the scientific community. Many social scientists from a wide range of disciplines will access the data system developed in this proposal",

abstract = "The maturation of the information age has created new challenges. Governments, faced with rapidly changing economies and societies are forced to make far-reaching economic and social policy decisions. These decisions, however, are based on limited static, and expensive survey data. At the same time, large administrative data sets are available that are derived from data collected from households, business establishments and governmental entities. These data, which could describe the dynamic interactions of workers, businesses, government and society, are not fully used in the United States, not simply because the unique advantages of these data have not been clear, but also because key issues of conf dentiality and access have not been fully addressed. This outcome has come at substantial cost. Linked data, if used wisely, have a great deal of scientific importance and can enhance our basic social data infrastructure in a number of ways. They can also be used to reduce respondent burden, increase data quality, and enhance the information available to the federal, state and local agencies which rely on Census Bureau data for decision making. In addition, these data can provide a valuable tool to the research community.

This research proposal will create three prototype data sets based upon the Census Bureau's demographic and economic products and using link information that permits the data sets to be longitudinal in both the household/individual and firm/establishment dimensions. The Principal Investigators, the Census Bureau, and other external researchers will use these data to examine the value of the claims made above. These data sets, while of immense use in their own right, will also advance knowledge in two additional ways. First, by creating the data and developing the access modality, the research team will explicitly address a series of confidentiality and access/availability issues, using internal Census Bureau expertise and that of external researchers at Comell University, the Urban Institute, the University of Maryland and NCSA. Second, the project will advance the knowledge of both linkage technology and the statistical properties of linked data so that researchers in all disciplines can use these techniques. The proposal delineates an extensive collaboration with the Census Bureau, which is indeed a major sponsor of the project, in addition to three European statistical agencies. The infrastructure project expects to involve additional government and private sector partners, particularly as the confidentiality issues are more fully addressed.

An innovative set of access support tools that combine a complete simulated environment (at the Comell University support site) with the latest in web-based collaboration tools (from the NCSA at the University of Illinois) will be developed. These tools will be integrated with videoJcomputer teleconferencing access to the Census Bureau and Cornell sites. Under carefully specified access rules that encompass established confidentiality and disclosure review procedures, the Census Bureau will support external research access to the linked data, using the web-based support tools and the video teleconferencing facilities. This external research access will go beyond 'state of the art' and its enhancement is another major activity covered in the proposal.

The Cornell University component also includes the support of a restricted-access data site that will house confidential linked data from the national statistical agencies of other countries. Linked French data from INSEE have already been approved for this site. Statistics Sweden has expressed a willingness to complete an agreement that would allow linked Swedish data. The DIW in Germany will release a linked version of the GSOEP to the site, if it is funded. Efforts continue to negotiate restricted access agreements with other national agencies. The restricted access data site provides linked data analysis tools and a supercomputer facility for use with these data.

The new knowledge that can be generated from these data is potentially far reaching. The prototype American data sets provide the capacity to address fundamental questions in social and economic behavior. The restricted-access data from other countries provides a laboratory in which to test the generality of results found for a particular country. All of the data advances in the proposal provide the opportunity to discover technological advances in confidentiality protection while enabling new partnerships to be formed across disciplines that focus on understanding social and economic systems, organizations and institutions.",

abstract="Data privacy is a fundamental problem of the modern information infrastructure. Increasing volumes of personal and sensitive data are collected and archived by health networks, government agencies, search engines, social networking websites, and other organizations. The social benefits of analyzing these databases are significant. At the same time, the release of information from sensitive data repositories can be devastating to the privacy of individuals and organizations. The challenge is to discover and release important characteristics of these databases without compromising the privacy of those whose data they contain. The main goal of this project is to design scalable computational techniques that are statistically sound, yield broadly useful data, and yet preserve privacy in the face of realistic external information. The project aims to integrate two essentially different approaches to the complex problem of data privacy. The reconciliation of these approaches raises a number of fundamental questions for statistical theory and cryptography, as well as methodological challenges that must be overcome to enable practical applications. This research is centered around three themes: (1) Integrating the computationally-focused, rigorous definitions of privacy emanating from computer science with notions of utility from statistics. (2) Developing cryptographic protocols for distributing privacy-preserving algorithms for valid statistical analysis among a group of servers so as to avoid pooling data in any single location. (3) Understanding the practical potential of the developed techniques by applying them to concrete problems in the behavioral and social sciences and analyzing important data sources from the official statistical community. The research will be carried out in collaboration with social scientists and industry researchers.
The project will increase awareness of data privacy issues and promote research on statistical disclosure limitation, cryptography and privacy-preserving data mining. Moreover, this research will transform the way statistical agencies, social scientists, medical researchers, and those in industry approach privacy?in particular, how they collect, share and publish information. The integration of statistical and cryptographic methods in the form of ex ante provably secure procedures will provide the essential scientific fundamentals for official statistical agencies to fulfill their mission of useful data production, which the proliferation of digital information has endangered. Finally, the new techniques will permit opening the vault of industrial data, such as search logs and data on social networks, to statistical analysis?greatly expanding the research domain of the social and health sciences.",

title={Social Science Gateway to TeraGrid},

number={0922005},
abstract="The Virtual Research Data Center at Cornell University has been a successful research support tool for users of many of the Census Bureau large-scale confidential data products including, but not limited to, those that are accessible via the Census Research Data Center network. Over 200 computational users and 600 download users have benefited from the VirtualRDC resources. Their scientific publications cite the NSF grants that supported the development of the VirtualRDC. The proposed activity seeks to keep this support network flourishing. In addition, most social science researchers face substantial hurdles when they wish to harness the power of large-scale computational clusters, in particular when using new, very large synthetic data sets with their unprecedented detail on people, jobs, and firms. The proposed activity seeks to extend the VirtualRDC model to allow support of tera-scale social science computing via the NSF-sponsored TeraGrid resources. The most widespread statistical software packages used by social scientists, i.e., SAS, Stata, and SPSS, are not available on the TeraGrid itself or on any of the servers at the borders of the TeraGrid with fast connections to it. When viewing the problem through the lens of the typical data-driven research process (extract, edit and transform data; transfer data to a computational location; and perform analysis) social science researchers are typically constrained in at least one of these steps when approaching the high-performance computing clusters on the TeraGrid. For most data preparation, and for much analysis, the lack of standard statistical analysis and data preparation software packages is a serious impediment. However, the typical social scientist workstation or university-provided computational infrastructure does not have the resources to handle these very large data sets. Furthermore, the social science workstation and the university-provided infrastructure do not have sufficiently fast data connectivity to transfer any large prepared data files to the TeraGrid for processing there. This project aims to remedy bottlenecks in the first and second steps, with a focused expansion of resources at a critical location resulting in a highly useful gateway to the TeraGrid for the social sciences. The project builds a social science TeraGrid gateway that (i) allows researchers to perform the data preparation step using their comfort-level software packages, speeding up the data preparation phase, and (ii) do so on servers that have a fast connection to the TeraGrid, thus greatly speeding up the data-transfer process. The third bottleneck absence of social statistics packages on the TeraGrid is not addressed by this proposal, since it would require resources, in particular licensing resources, an order of magnitude larger than our proposed budget. This step is left to future proposals.
Broader impacts: Tera-scale social science data are underutilized. Initially, serious confidentiality issues prevented most researchers from accessing these data. Significant research effort on projects that solve most of these confidentiality issues in combination with an expansion of the restricted-access model via Census Research Data Centers has begun to address this underutilization. Now that an increasing number of previously confidential data sources are finding their way into the public domain, the quantity of social science public-use data is once-again expanding dramatically. This project proposes a method of unlocking those recently released data sources to allow much broader access by the research community. Research strategies such as very large scale resampling and synthesis, which were previously proposed but not technically feasible, will be implemented. The expected explosion of use will lead to new results in a multitude of social sciences. The knowledge gained from running the Social Science TeraGrid Gateway will be leveraged and applied to future proposals in which the third identified bottleneck the absence of familiar software for social scientists on large-scale computing resources will be addressed. The PIs on this proposal are actively involved with other research teams that are moving forward with the development of such proposals. The long-term goal of this proposal is that the tools put together for the research community through this proposal will be the building blocks for bigger, and more transparent mechanisms, for granting social scientists easy access to large-scale computational facilities.",

abstract="Researchers throughout the social, behavioral, economic, and health sciences use data to test hypotheses about a wide range of individual and social behaviors, decisions, and outcomes. Government statistical agencies regularly collect data that are extremely valuable for this purpose. However, these data are not made directly available to the research community because the data providers' (responents') identity is part of the data itself. Therefore statistical agencies and the scientific community have been developing methods to make analytically valid and highly detailed data available to researchers while simultaneously protecting individual privacy.
A particularly valuable and sensitive kind of data is linked administrative data such as the Longitudinal Employer-Household Data (LEHD), the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) and surveys with linked administrative data (SIPP). These datasets have been constructed with support from statistical agencies and the NSF. The highly detailed nature of these data make them particularly sensitive, and access to the micro-data remains restriced. One approach for balancing the tension between confientiality protection and access is the generation of synthetic data. The process for generating such data begins by estimating a posterior predictive distribution (PPD) of the to-be-released data given the confidential micro-data. The next step is to draw samples from the PPD to produce the released micro-data. The quality of inferences based on a wide variety of models applied to synthetic and actual data has been indaquately assessed to date because only a limited number of users have had access to both data sources. This kind of assessment needs to be integrated within a quality-feedback loop in order to improve synthetic data and increase the use of the data by the research community. This award facilitiates such a feedback loop for synthetic versions of two datasetss: the Census Bureau's Survey of Income and Program Participation and the Longitudinal Business Database. The goal is to broaden access to the data, enhance the feedback loop, and provide flexible and secure access to these synthetic data early releases.
A variety of social scientists from a range of disciplines will be able to use this data access method and will provide detailed input that will guide future improvements in data quality.",
