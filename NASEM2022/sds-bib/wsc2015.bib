	abstract = {We use the bipartite graph representation of longitudinally linked employer-employee data, and the associated projections onto the employer and employee nodes, respectively, to characterize the set of potential statistical summaries that the trusted custodian might produce. We consider noise infusion as the primary confidentiality protection method. We show that a relatively straightforward extension of the dynamic noise-infusion method used in the U.S. Census Bureau{\textquoteright}s Quarterly Workforce Indicators can be adapted to provide the same confidentiality guarantees for the graph-based statistics: all inputs have been modified by a minimum percentage deviation (i.e., no actual respondent data are used) and, as the number of entities contributing to a particular statistic increases, the accuracy of that statistic approaches the unprotected value. Our method also ensures that the protected statistics will be identical in all releases based on the same inputs.},

	abstract = {In contrast to the many public-use microdata samples available for individual and household data from many statistical agencies around the world, there are virtually no establishment or firm microdata available. In large part, this difficulty in providing access to business microdata is due to the skewed and sparse distributions that characterize business data. Synthetic data are simulated data generated from statistical models. We organized sessions at the 2015 World Statistical Congress and the 2015 Joint Statistical Meetings, highlighting work on synthetic \emph{establishment} microdata. This overview situates those papers, published in this issue, within the broader literature.},

	abstract = {Brazil, like many countries, is reluctant to publish business-level data, because of legitimate concerns about the establishments{\textquoteright} confidentiality. A trusted data curator can increase the utility of data, while managing the risk to establishments, either by releasing synthetic data, or by infusing noise into published statistics. This paper evaluates the application of a differentially private mechanism to publish statistics on wages and job mobility computed from Brazilian employer-employee matched data. The publication mechanism can result in both the publication of specific statistics as well as the generation of synthetic data. I find that the tradeoff between the privacy guaranteed to individuals in the data, and the accuracy of published statistics, is potentially much better that the worst-case theoretical accuracy guarantee. However, the synthetic data fare quite poorly in analyses that are outside the set of queries to which it was trained. Note that this article only explores and characterizes the feasibility of these publication strategies, and will not directly result in the publication of any data. },
