  abstract = {In most countries, national statistical agencies do not release establishment-level
	business microdata, because doing so represents too large a risk
	to establishments\' confidentiality. One approach with the potential
	for overcoming these risks is to release synthetic data; that is,
	the released establishment data are simulated from statistical models
	designed to mimic the distributions of the underlying real microdata.
	In this article, we describe an application of this strategy to create
	a public use file for the Longitudinal Business Database, an annual
	economic census of establishments in the United States comprising
	more than 20 million records dating back to 1976. The U.S. Bureau
	of the Census and the Internal Revenue Service recently approved
	the release of these synthetic microdata for public use, making the
	synthetic Longitudinal Business Database the first-ever business
	microdata set publicly released in the United States. We describe
	how we created the synthetic data, evaluated analytical validity,
	and assessed disclosure risk.},
