# Challenges

## Automation or streamlining of disclosure avoidance


Scalability of a system **hinges critically on streamlined output vetting**. 

However, the challenge of creating automated and reliable disclosure avoidance procedures *is  not unique* to the validation process described here.

## Security of containers

In general, bad idea to blindly run untrusted containers. However, this is a **solved problem** in the industry, facilitated by the (expected) sparsity of the build process.

## User acceptance

As a reminder, most social scientists are **not familiar with containers**.

- **Mitigation**:
  - Off-the-shelf solutions (Codeocean, Whole Tale)
  - IT support at universities and research institutions
