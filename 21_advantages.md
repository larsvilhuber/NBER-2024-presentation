# Advantages

## Existing technology

- Containers are well-known technology, including in other sciences 
- Used by online services (Codeocean, but also Overleaf, etc.)

## Scalability

- Easy to scale to large number of users
- Easy to scale to technologies that allow for sophisticated but computing intensive disclosure avoidance

## Cheap
  
- for users
  - most of the core enabling technology is free to use
  - support by university IT is generally available

- for providers (*StatAgency*)
  - no need to provision scaled infrastructure for users
  - can leverage existing on-site software stacks (e.g., assuming that anything used internally is already security-vetted)

## Additional benefit

- **StatAgency** can accumulate a library of confirmed reproducible containers and models, and can test out new data, disclosure methods, etc. at scale against prior scientific findings

. . . 

**Consider the new disclosure avoidance method for ACS 2035**

- Can be tested against every submitted model that used prior ACS, as long as database schema is the same.
