# Background

## Anecdotal evidence with SDS

From conversations/informal surveys:

- researchers were happy with the ability to access data without having to request a full-blown project in an FSRDC
- somewhat frustrated by the process (slowness)

## Reproducibility and SDS

SDS validation required typically substantial human debugging

- Reason:  problems with the reproducibility of code in the social sciences despite similarity of environment. 

## Intermediate causes

- no strong pre-testing of reproducibility, often intense use of interactive programming practices
- divergence in environments over time
- divergence of data schemas over time

**Failure to maintain strong links**

## Some broader evidence

In a sample of over **8,000 replication packages** associated with high-profile economics articles, **only 30% had some sort of master script**. 

## Other systems

Statistical agencies and research institutes have explored various ways to scale up access to confidential data, without full (remote) access to confidential data.

- Statistics Canada: [Real Time Remote Access (RTRA)](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/microdata/rtra) process, 
- Norway:  [Microdata.no](microdata.no) system, 
- Germany/IAB: [JoSuA system](https://fdz.iab.de/en/data-access/on-site-use/)


## Access restrictions

Most such processes have limitations, including in their utility for general purpose analysis

Most still have some **strong access limitations**

  - RTRA: organizational application process
  - microdata.no: Institutional MOU (and only Norwegian residents)
  - IAB: proposal process

## Analysis restrictions

Many systems strongly **limit the type of analysis** that is feasible by 

- RTRA: restricting the software keywords that can be used, subset of SAS allowing to "calculate frequencies, means, percentiles, percent distribution, proportions, ratios and shares.  
- microdata.no: by creating a structured new statistical language (albeit with increasingly sophisticated capabilities)

## Comparison

The comparison researchers and analysts make is (for right or wrong) to the **unfettered use of public-use data**...
