# The quest

## Direct access is expensive

Remote-access or local secure access in the form of physical or virtual secure data enclaves is still the dominant - **but expensive** - way to access confidential data. 

> The dominant method of access thus forces researchers to choose between **lower quality data** in an environment that corresponds to their preferred computing method (*public-use data*), and **higher quality confidential data** in environments that are *expensive* for researchers, data providers, or both.
